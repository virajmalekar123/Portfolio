After completeing my bachleor of engineering degree in computer science stream, I was very much intrigued about how websites work. After understanding the web basics from my college and mastering the basics, there was no turning back I tried to develop some basic designs that are visually appealing<br>

Making simple yet efficient web designs is my strength. I find myself addicted to finding new design inspirations for development. When I am not developing websites I like to explore the world of music by learning various musical insruments. I also like to get my hands on new frameworks in industry and try to learn as much as possible
